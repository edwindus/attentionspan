[Prince](https://prince.com) was a common thread in my life ever since I saw the [When Doves cry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG3VcCAlUgE) video on TV in 1984.
Prince taught lyrics, and funk, and rock, and jazz.
Prince was my first real concert and many a night spent in front of the 'Ben Noz' ticketshop.
Prince fans taught me about bootlegs that I would subsequently chase and collect and share for years.
Prince taught me about poetry and women, and sex ... but Prince's work also guided me through long and lonely nights when I needed to feel the ground beneath my feet.

_I was lucky to be alive when Prince was here and making music._
