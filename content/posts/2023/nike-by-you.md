# Nike Air Force 1
In 1982 [Nike](https://www.shoepalace.com/blogs/all/the-history-of-nike) introduced their first baseball shoes utilising their successful Nike Air technology. The shoes were call Nike Air Force as a reference to [Air Force One plane](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104588/vc-25-air-force-one/) of the [POTUS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States).
The model was discontinued 2 years later but re-released back in 1986 as the Nike Air Force 1 and became especially populair in the US [East-coast Hip Hop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_hip_hop) scene.
The Nike Air Force 1 is [now over 40 years old](https://www.nike.com/air-force-1), produced in three different heights and popular as ever, specially the “White-on-White” version.

The most recent pair of Nike Air Force 1 that I have were a pair of Nike Air Force 1 High ’07 LV8 in full beige suede. LV8 in the models designation is a play on “elevate” for the slightly elevated soles in comparison to the regular ’07 models.

# Nike Air Max 90
In 1987 another sneaker with a different design was released, also utilizing the [Nike Air technology](https://www.goat.com/editorial/nike-air-max-sneakers-history). The third edition of this design, released in 1990 and baptized Nike Air Max III. From 2000 onwards, this shoe became know as the [Nike Air Max 90](https://cultedge.com/history-nike-air-max-90/) and I have owned several black-on-black pairs since then.

# NIKE BY YOU
Now I wanted a new pair and decided on Nike Air Force 1 Mid ’07, that should be a little better for driving. But browsing for shoes I came across the [_NIKE BY YOU_](https://www.nike.com/nl/en/w/mens-nike-by-you-shoes-6ealhznik1zy7ok) program. Here you can design your own sneakers, that sounded like fun (and hey, we were drawing our own sneakers all the time in the eighties).

After a little fiddling with the online editor; I decided to pay homage to my [Black Edition Audi](https://youtu.be/rCChHiiqUfY) in Sepang Blue. When purely Black & _Old Royal Blue_ scheme turned out a little too boring, the Nike swoosh became _Sport Red_ for contrast in the final design. The _Tip_ (front) and _Foxing_ (heel) are different to give a bit of a 'racing shoes' feeling (who would actually race with basketball shoes ?!).  
Production and delivery took a couple of weeks during which regular updates were received by email.
