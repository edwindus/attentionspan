summary: "... but I like deep conversation with honest people"
---

I want to talk about atoms, society, ideas, sex and conventions  
About the meaning of life, faraway galaxies, lyrics and poems  
About your heroes, your favorite books and the music you love  
About your insecurities and what keeps you up at night  

I like deep conversation with honest people, people with depth  
People with ideas and fantasies, people with plans and projects  
People who speak with emotion from a slightly twisted mind  

... but I hate small talk
