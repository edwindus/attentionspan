_Phototypesetting is a method of setting type which uses photography to make columns of type on a scroll of photographic paper. It has been made obsolete by the popularity of the personal computer and desktop publishing which gave rise to digital typesetting._

On this page a reasonable overview of the Berthold Fototype opto-mechnical typesetting machines from a brochure dated 1985, still in my archives and now uploaded to [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/@edwin_dus).

A multi-terminal _Text Production System_ with up to 10 intelligent, interactive workplaces.
The central computer (96 KB) works as manager of the data in the memory and controls the flow of data to the peripheral units.
Each of the 10 terminals has its own computer (32 KB) and direct access to the hard disk.
Hard disk drives with a memory capacity of 80 MB or 300 MB are available.
Two drives can be connected to each central unit.

Each terminal can permit the re-recording of the list of the tables of contents and the jobs stored under each table of contents.
