# History of dacorsa.com

*Sure, I might have had a Ferrari poster on the wall as a child, but my fascination for Ferrari started in 1990 with the Bburago 1997 Ferrari F40 model (cod. 3032).
Let's try to reconstruct the timeline leading up to the current version of dacorsa.com*

#### 1994 - Cavallo Scrimante Modelcars
There were only a handful of 1:18 scale Ferraris available, but I liked to improve and make race versions of the [Bburago](http://www.bburago.com) models. When I went to *Circuit Zandvoort* for the first time there was this small company called *Cavallo Scrimante modelcars* in the paddock that were selling modified 1:18 scale racecars of Dutch drivers, like Dick Waaijenberg and Michel Oprey. Seeing the Ferrari F40 Competition on track and leaving home with a reasonably matching 1:18 scale model of the same car was something fascinating.

I quickly became a regular visitor of their home and workshop in the south of the Netherlands where they told me all those stories about their adventures at the 1997 festivities in *Maranello* and how  should visit this birthplace of Ferrari.  

#### 1998 - Spa Ferrari Days
The *Shell Ferrari Historic Challenge* was in its heyday, so when visiting the *Spa Ferrari Days* there was a plethora of classic race cars, some with impressive pedigree. The concept of chassis numers quickly made sense and I started to make sure that each picture I took was annotated with the chassis number of the particular car.  
And started buying books; with one important restriction; each book should include chassis numbers where referencing Ferraris.

The internet was becoming mainstream in the Netherlands when I discovered this fansite for *Emanuele Pirro* that was also publishing information on Ferraris, each image annotated with the chassis information. Somehow I got in contact with the "webmaster" (who later proved to be a vintage Ferrari collector) and I could contribute some pictures and information to their Ferrari section that was eventually separated from *pirro.com* and called [maranello.cc](http://maranello.cc).

#### 1999 - release of dacorsa.net
The main sponsor of maranello.cc was creating software to publish websites, but with whole different approach than Microsoft Frontpage. I was given a beta copy of the software and created the first version of dacorsa.net publishing my contributions to other websites and magazines. The image above shows a screenshot of this first version on a typical computer for that era. 

1999 was the year that I learned about this international group of people called *"Telaio"* that were really into registering chassis numbers of Ferraris, and I was fortunate ennough to be allowed to join them. As part of an assignment for my professional education, I modelled a database in [Microsoft Access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Access). The new website and database would prove to be long living interests.

#### 2000 - editthispage.com
The image above shows a screenshot of this second version of dacorsa.net, created and hosted on editthispage.com of Radio Userland. Professionally I became interested in the subjects [Dave Winer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Winer) and Adam Curry were working on; outliners, RSS (and what later would become podcasting) in particular. Dave created [Radio Userland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_UserLand) where a website was basically defined as a text-based outline (content) against a template that adds layout and colour. The concept of editing a webpage right on the web was made quite spectacular at that moment in time.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ijsselstein/50825426433/in/dateposted-public/" title="2003 dacorsa.net in PHP Nuke"><img class="size_m" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50825426433_a44297e1af_b.jpg" alt="2003 dacorsa.net (PHP Nuke)"></a>

#### 2003 - Online Content Management with PHP Nuke
At the daytime job I was working with big and expensive content management systems and portals, so when open-source software with similar (albeit small scale) capabilites became mainstream, I could not withstand the urge to try it out and created a new version of dacorsa.net. This time developed in the PHP programming language using [PHP Nuke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP-Nuke) and hosted on a shared virtual server. The image above shows the PHP Nuke version of dacorsa.net where the typical portal look of PHP Nuke can be easily recognised.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ijsselstein/50826268467/in/dateposted-public/" title="2003 dacorsa.net on Typo3 CMS"><img class="size_m" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50826268467_a935f4e632_b.jpg" alt="2003 dacorsa.net (Typo3)"></a>

#### 2003 - Online Content Management with Typo3 CMS
PHP Nuke was a nice excercise but the content of dacorsa.net was growing quickly and everything was stored in an unstructured database that felt pretty bad (for a software engineer ;-). Another open-source project was picked called [Typo3 Content Management System]([https://typo3.org), open-source too but very professional and capable software that could easily compare to the big and expensive corporate CMS systems we worked with in the daytime job. A template could be built from scratch, there was a scripting language and above all, you can model a database for your own data. The picture below shows a screenshot of this fourth version of dacorsa.net, published in 2003.

This was a nice and professional architecture and the start of something way more important (for me). I have been collection chassis information and results of all the events I attended but this was mostly stored in seperate lists and partly in the (offline) database modelled in [Microsoft Access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Access) a couple of years earlier. Now, with Typo3, the database started in 1999, becomes the 'single point of entry' and is even "always online".

#### 2004 and 2005 - overhauled the Typo3 CMS based dacorsa.net
Not too much to explain about these ones; just new versions; more generated menu's and different look-and-feel.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ijsselstein/50826172721/in/dateposted-public/" title="2011 dacorsa.com on Joomla CMS"><img class="size_m" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50826172721_05eb29c64a_b.jpg" alt="2011 dacorsa.com"></a>

#### 2011 - Online Content Management with Joomla
New open-source software keeps appearing on the marked and after creating a couple of other websites with [Mambo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mambo_%28software%29) and [Joomla CMS](https://www.joomla.org) it felt time to move dacorsa.net over to this more modern software.
Ofcourse my [Joomla](https://www.joomla.org) implementation of dacorsa.net kept my dedicated [SQL database](https://www.mysql.com) which by now had grown quite big. I introduced a "staging" environment to have a safe offline copy of the database (that I work on almost daily) and publish to the web every now and then. I was also (finally) able the acquire the [.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.com) domain name, so the site continued to live as dacorsa.com. The image above shows a screenshot of this first version on a typical computer for that era.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ijsselstein/50826172666/in/dateposted-public/" title="2016 dacorsa.com as statically generated site"><img class="size_m" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50826172666_cc6858f6f1_b.jpg" alt="2016 dacorsa.com"></a>

#### 2016 - Static HTML website
The database had became more and more complex which made it difficult to find (cheap) hosting for it. Also there was quite some information in there that was not meant for publication. So having the database online becomes a security problem.
Last but not least, Joomla became so popular that I had to deal with attacks on the website on an almost daily basis.
The 2016 release saw a new (for most people controversial) approach; I created some purpose-made [PHP](https://www.php.net) software that generated a static HTML snapshot of the website, that can literally be hosted anywhere and attacking these files makes no sense.

#### 2021 - Starting from scratch again
Life happened and while I did work on my database quite often, releasing new updates was less of a priority. At some point in 2020 I started working on a new generator (this time written in Java) against the offline database and the set of high-resolution scans that are related to the objects in the database. This complex Java generator creates snapshots of the database in json files and converts the high-resolution scans into more web-friendly version of those (event posters and book covers mostly) images. Both the images and the json files are static exports, keeping most of the information in the database out-of-risk and keep hosting cheap and easy.

An Angular frontend application is added for the look-and-feel. And here it is in all it's glory (until the urge for new software becomes too big to ignore ;-).  
In the meantime, please enjoy and please correct or contribute whatever you can !
