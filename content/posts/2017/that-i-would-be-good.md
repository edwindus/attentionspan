---

Scars form as part of the healing process after you have been physically hurt. After the healing process, you are fine and functioning again, with the scar as a little reminder of the process you went through.
But what if you were psychologically hurt, worked hard to become fine and functioning again, should that process have left a scar too ?

While I am not a particular [Alanis Morisette](https://alanis.com) fan, the [ MTV Unplugged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV_Unplugged_(Alanis_Morissette_album)) album of 1999 has been steady in my top 10 of listened albums ever since. At one point the idea just stuck; the lyrics of _[That I Would Be Good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_I_Would_Be_Good)_ are a perfect representation of my process.  
To tattoo this _"as if I've just written it with a Sharpie"_ would be that _scar_ for me.

### Lyrics

_That I would be good, even if I did nothing_  
_That I would be good, even if I got the thumbs down_  
_That I would be good if I got and stayed sick_  
_That I would be good even if I gained ten pounds_  

_That I would be fine even if I went bankrupt_  
_That I would be good if I lost my hair and my youth_  
_That I would be great if I was no longer queen_  
_That I would be grand if I was not all knowing_  

_That I would be loved even when I numb myself_  
_That I would be good even when I am overwhelmed_  
_That I would be loved even when I was fuming_  
_That I would be good even if I was clingy_  
_That I would be good even if I lost sanity_

_That I would be good_  
_Whether with or without you_
