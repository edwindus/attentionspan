The [Marlboro Masters of Formula 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_of_Formula_3) in 1993 was the first event that brought me to a real racetrack, the [Circuit Park Zandvoort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_Zandvoort). The Marlboro Masters of Formula 3 was pretty popular in those days, not in the least because the free tickets were provided by the sponsoring cigarette manufacturer at many outlets.
The [Bburago](http://www.bburago.com) F40 model in 1:18 scale was popular and seeing racing F40's in the Kumho Ferrari-Porsche challenge sparked an interest. That interest would eventually result in press accredition for following the [Tour de France Automobile](https://dacorsa.com/events/ta/) revival and the Shell Historic Ferrari Maserati Challenge.
While all the circuits I have visited so far are relatively close to home in the very western part of Europe, it was still fun to compile this list.
