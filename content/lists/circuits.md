The Marlboro Masters in 1993 was the first event that brought me to a real racetrack, the circuit of Zandvoort. The Marlboro Masters of Formula 3 was pretty popular in those days, not in the least because the free tickets were provided by the sponsoring cigarette manufacturer at many outlets.
The Bburago F40 model in 1:18 scale was popular and seeing racing F40's in the Kumho Ferrari-Porsche challenge sparked an interest. That interesting would eventually result in press accredition for following the Tour de France Automobile revival and the Shell Historic Ferrari Maserati Challenge.
While all the circuits I have visited so far are relatively close to home in the very western part of Europe, it was still fun to compile this list.
