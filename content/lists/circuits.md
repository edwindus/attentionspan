The Marlboro Masters in 1993 was the first event that brought me to a real racetrack, the circuit of Zandvoort. The Marlboro Masters of Formula 3 was pretty popular in those days, not in the least because the free tickets were provided by the sponsoring cigarette manufacturer at many outlets.
The BBurago F40 model in 1:18 scale was popular and seeing racing F40's in the Kumho Ferrari-Porsche challenge sparked an interest eventually resulting in press accredition for following the Tour de France Automobile revival and the Shell Historic Ferrari Maserati Challenge.
While the circuits I have visited are all in the very western part of Europe, it was still fun to compile and plot the list.
