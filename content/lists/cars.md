summary: "Cars we owned"
---

A mix of (mostly German) cars we have owned over the years, from with the [first car](#1979-ford-escort-mk-ii) I bought right after I got my drivers license at nineteen. Some cars were leased and ordered new, but most of the cars we bought of a first- or consecutive owner. The [Volvo S60](#2002-volvo-s60) and a [Volkswagen Polo](#1998-volkswagen-polo-mk-3) were imported from Germany. Most cars were sold or traded in after some time, but we also brought the [Ford Escort](#1979-ford-escort-mk-ii) and a [Volkswagen Polo](#1998-volkswagen-polo-mk-3) to the junk yard, and exported the [Audi 100](#1993-audi-100) car to Eastern Europe.
