summary: "Cars we owned"
---

A mix of (mostly German) cars we have owned over the years. Some were leased and ordered new, but most of most cars we bought from the first- or consecutive owner. Imported the [Volvo S60](#2002-volvo-s60) and a [Volkswagen Polo](#1998-volkswagen-polo-mk-3) from Germany. Most cars were sold on or traded in after some time, but we also brought a [Ford Escort](#1979-ford-escort-mk-ii) and a [Volkswagen Polo](#1998-volkswagen-polo-mk-3) cars to a junk yard, and exported the [Audi 100](#1993-audi-100) car to eastern europe etc.
