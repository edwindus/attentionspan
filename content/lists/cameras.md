A trip down memory lane, starting with the analog 110 film point & shoot (using tiny 13×17 mm frames) and ending with my trusted 24×36 mm full-frame digital single-lens reflex workhorse. Switched from Canon to Nikon with the first DSLR, but renting big zoomlenses for Nikon proved to be way more difficult, so I switched back to Canon in the end. Before there were iPhones with great resolution cameras, we also had a small digicam, since bringing a DSLR wasn't always appreciated.
